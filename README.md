# üè• Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard (Power BI)
This project presents a comprehensive data analysis of a hospital emergency room (ER), developed entirely in Power BI. It aims to provide insightful metrics and trends to optimize the workflow and enhance patient care within the healthcare domain.
### üéØ Project Goal
The primary goal of this project is to transform raw ER data into actionable insights through interactive dashboard. By analyzing various aspects of patient visits, wait times, satisfaction, and admissions, the dashboard helps in understanding patterns, identifying areas for improvement, and making informed decisions for resource management and operational efficiency

## ‚ú® Features and Dashboards
The project consists of four interconnected dashboards, each designed to provide a specific view of the ER operations:
###  Monthly View Dashboard
This dashboard offers a month-by-month monitoring of key metrics and trends, allowing users to identify patterns and areas for improvement over time. 
It is fully dynamic and interactive, enabling filtering by specific months and years, and allowing users to click on visual elements to filter the entire dashboard.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) displayed include:

‚Ä¢Number of Patients: Measures daily ER visits with a sparkline to show trends and identify peak days.

‚Ä¢Average Wait Time: Calculates the average waiting time for patients, with a sparkline for daily trends.

‚Ä¢Patient Satisfaction Score: Evaluates the quality of service provided on a daily basis.

‚Ä¢Number of Patients Referred: Identifies how many patients were referred to specific departments within the emergency room.

#### Detailed Charts and Analysis:
‚Ä¢Patient Admission Status: Tracks admitted versus non-admitted patients, showing counts and percentages.

‚Ä¢Patient Age Distribution: Groups patients by 10-year age intervals to understand demographic visitation patterns.

‚Ä¢Department Referrals: Shows patient distribution across different medical departments.

‚Ä¢Timeliness: Measures the percentage of patients seen within an ideal 30-minute wait time, indicating performance against a target.

‚Ä¢Gender Analysis: Distributes patients by gender (Male, Female, Not Confirmed).

‚Ä¢Racial Demographics: Analyzes patient distribution based on race (e.g., White, American Asian, African American).

‚Ä¢Time Analysis (Heat Map): Visualizes the volume of patients visiting the ER by day of the week and hour of the day, aiding in resource and inventory management
